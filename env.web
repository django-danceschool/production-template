# you will not only get the site up and running, but you will automatically
# set up SSL encryption for your site as well.

# SECURITY WARNING: ALLOWED_HOST must be updated for production to permit public
# access of the site.
# Because * is currently allowed, this project is insecure by default. It is STRONGLY recommended

# The Nginx (web server) proxy needs to know what hostname to listen for, and what
# port to forward those requests to.  So, enter the hostnome at which your site will
